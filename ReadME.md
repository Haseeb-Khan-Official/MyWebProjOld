# HTML & CSS Practice

A **two-version** learning journey — from my very first HTML & CSS webpage (full of beginner mistakes) to a more refined, upgraded version using modern CSS techniques.

---

## Project Structure

- **`v1-basic/`**

  - My **first ever** complete webpage.
  - Written with plenty of trial-and-error and beginner mistakes.
  - Styled using only **basic CSS**: paddings, margins, and simple layouts.

- **`v2-upgraded/`**
  - An improved version of the same project.
  - Introduces **CSS selectors**, **Flexbox**, **CSS Grid**, and a touch of **media queries** for responsiveness.

---

## Purpose

- Practice and improve my HTML & CSS skills.
- Learn by building the same webpage twice — once as a beginner and again with more skills.

---

## Features

- **Version 1:** Simple static layout with basic styling.
- **Version 2:**
  - Modern layout techniques with Flexbox and Grid.
  - Better use of CSS selectors.
  - Basic responsive design via media queries.

## Lessons Learned

- How proper structure in HTML makes styling easier.
- Why Flexbox and Grid are game-changers for layouts.
- The importance of revisiting old code to improve it.
